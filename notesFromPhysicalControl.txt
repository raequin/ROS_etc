ROS on multiple machines

  <> http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines

  <> These Ubuntu computers are not publishing (?) hostname so they're only resolvable (ssh, ping, etc.) by IP address

  <> Example with two computers, A and B

A$ roscore

A$ hostname -I
<IP_A>
A$ export ROS_IP=<IP_A>
A$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<IP_A>:11311
A$ rosrun tutorials_etc listener.py

B$ hostname -I
<IP_B>
B$ export ROS_IP=<IP_B>
B$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<IP_A>:11311
B$ rosrun tutorials_etc talker.py

  <?> Are these exports good for every terminal thereafter or just that one?

  <> Copy files from one computer to another:

$ scp <source> <destination>
To copy a file from B to A while logged into B:
B$ scp /path/to/file username@a:/path/to/destination
